Welcome to Lawbridge, a sophisticated, context-aware legal chatbot designed to provide users with accurate and quick legal information. It leverages a powerful **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system to deliver human-like, contextually appropriate responses, acting as a first point of reference for legal queries.

##  Key Features

  * **Context-Aware Responses**: Utilizes a RAG system built with **LangChain** for high accuracy and relevance.
  * **High-Performance AI**: Integrates **HuggingFace** and **Cohere** models to generate precise answers.
  * **Fast & Efficient**: Delivers responses with an average time of just **3 seconds** per query.
  * **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system, including a "Continue with Google" option.
  * **Chat History**: Allows users to view and revisit their past legal queries and the responses received.
  * **Admin Interface**: Separate login portal for administrative management.
  * **Robust Backend**: Powered by a **Flask** backend with over 10 dedicated API endpoints.
  * **Scalable Database**: Manages all user profiles and chat histories efficiently using **Google Firebase**.

##  Tech Stack & Architecture

The core of Lawbridge is its **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture, which ensures that the chatbot's responses are not just fluent but also factually grounded in a specific knowledge base.

1.  **Backend**: **Flask** serves as the web framework, handling routing, requests, and business logic.
2.  **Frontend**: **Jinja2 Templates** are used to dynamically render the user interface.
3.  **AI Orchestration**: **LangChain** orchestrates the complex workflow of the RAG system.
4.  **AI Models**: The system leverages cutting-edge models from **HuggingFace** and **Cohere** for natural language understanding and generation.
5.  **Database**: **Google Firebase** is used for its real-time capabilities to store and manage user data and chat histories.
